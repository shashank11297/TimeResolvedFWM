# TimeResolvedFWM

The aim of this project is to numerically calculate the 3rd order microscopic current using extended Kubo Formalism when a solid/crystal is perturbed with Ultra-fast Laser pusles (paper coming soon). The numerical analysis is done in Mathematica v12.3 and the data analysis is done using Python.

## DFT_band directory

This directrory contains the calculation of Density functional theory calculation to calculate the band structure of MgO and ZnO.
